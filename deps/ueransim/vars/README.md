# OnRamp Variables

File `main.yml` specifies global variables used to configure how Aether is deployed.
By default, it is configured for the Quick Start deployment. The other files define
common configurations, any one of which you can copy to `main.yml`, and then
edit to account for your local details. These alternative configurations include:

* `main-ueransim.yml`: Configures the RAN emulator (ueransim) to run in one or more
   servers, independent of the Core.
